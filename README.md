## Running Python Scripts
### Initiating the virtual environment - this project uses pipenv to manage virtual environments. 

1. If running the script for the first time, navigate to the AFOLU_CALC directory, then type the following:
- pipenv install (if using pipenv for the first time, otherwise bypass this step)
- pipenv shell

2. If not running for the first time, navigate to the AFOLU_CALC directory, then type the following:
- pipenv shell
