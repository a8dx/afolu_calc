# afolu_calc

## Running Python Scripts
### Initiating the virtual environment - this project uses pipenv to manage virtual environments. 

1. If running the script for the first time, navigate to the AFOLU_CALC directory, then type the following:
- pipenv install (if using pipenv for the first time, otherwise bypass this step)
- pipenv shell

2. If not running for the first time, navigate to the AFOLU_CALC directory, then type the following:
- pipenv shell

3. If you have not run the script for some time, updates may have been made to Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. To ensure you are running the most up-to-date Pipfiles, you can upgrade packages by navigating to AFOLU_CALC directory and in the terminal, type the following commands:
- pipenv update
- pipenv shell
